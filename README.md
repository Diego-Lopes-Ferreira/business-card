# Business Card
> React project where I tested how to work with animations based on mouse movement, and learned how to use masks in CSS. On the example I made a Sherlock Holmes style business card

## Features:
* Uses mouse movement to animate the screen
* It's responsive - doesn't move when running on mobile.
